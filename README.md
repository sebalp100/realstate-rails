Simple website made with Rails 7.1 and Ruby 3.2.2. It was made following the next requirements:

- Ruby on Rails 7.1 application with tailwind CSS as the CSS framework.
- Model called Listings, it should have an address and description field and one image.
- Index page on the listings controller that looks like the Figma file. Use tailwind CSS for the styling and make it responsive to work on mobile and desktop.
- Everything on the page can be static except for the listings, those should be database driven.

Tested in Chrome 124.0 and Firefox 126.0.
